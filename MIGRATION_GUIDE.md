# Content Migration Guide

## ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Content Migration

This guide will walk you through transferring your existing content from the static pages to Sanity CMS.

## Phase 1: Prepare Migration Data

### Step 1: Run the Migration Script
```bash
node migrate-content.js
```

This will create three JSON files with your existing content:
- `sanity-team-members.json` - All 18 team members
- `sanity-research-areas.json` - All 5 research areas  
- `sanity-home-content.json` - Home page content

### Step 2: Start Sanity Studio
```bash
npm run sanity:dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3333` in your browser.

## Phase 2: Migrate Team Members

### For Each Team Member:

1. **Click "Team Member" in Sanity Studio**
2. **Click "Create new Team Member"**
3. **Fill in the fields** using data from `sanity-team-members.json`:

#### Example - Dr. Vivien Sheehan:
```
Name: Dr. Vivien A. Sheehan
Role: Principal Investigator  
Group: pi
Bio: [Copy the full bio from JSON]
Email: vivien.sheehan@emory.edu
Display Order: 1
Active: âœ… (checked)
```

4. **Upload Image**:
   - Click the "Image" field
   - Upload the image from `public/images/headshots/vivien.png`
   - Add alt text: "Dr. Vivien A. Sheehan"

5. **Click "Publish"**

### âš¡ Speed Tips for Team Members:
- Keep the JSON file open in another tab for easy copying
- Images are in `public/images/headshots/`
- Groups are: `pi`, `lab_manager`, `faculty`, `research_staff`
- Set Display Order 1-18 to maintain current ordering

## Phase 3: Migrate Research Areas

### For Each Research Area:

1. **Click "Research Area" in Sanity Studio**
2. **Click "Create new Research Area"**
3. **Fill in the fields** using data from `sanity-research-areas.json`:

#### Example - IGFBP3 Research:
```
Title: IGFBP3 Research
Slug: igfbp3 (auto-generated)
Summary: [Copy from JSON]
Order: 1
Published: âœ… (checked)
```

4. **Description Field** (Rich Text):
   - Click in the description field
   - Paste the description text from JSON
   - Use the toolbar to add formatting if needed

5. **Highlights Array**:
   - Click "Add item" for each highlight
   - Copy each bullet point from the JSON

6. **Upload Images**:
   - Primary Image: Upload from `public/images/research/igfbp3.png`
   - Secondary Image: Upload from `public/images/research/igf2.png`

7. **Click "Publish"**

### Research Area Image Paths:
```
IGFBP3: /images/research/igfbp3.png + /images/research/igf2.png
Xenograft: /images/research/mobilization.png
CRISPR: /images/genomics-research-lab.jpg
Alloimmunization: /images/alloimmunization-research.jpg
Microfluidics: /images/research/microfluidics.png
```

## Phase 4: Migrate Home Page Content

1. **Click "Page Content" in Sanity Studio**
2. **Click "Create new Page Content"**
3. **Fill in the fields**:

```
Page ID: home
Title: Sheehan Lab
Subtitle: Advancing Sickle Cell Disease Research
Meta Description: [Copy from JSON]
```

4. **Content Field** (Rich Text):
   - Paste the content from `sanity-home-content.json`
   - Add formatting using the rich text toolbar

5. **Hero Image** (Optional):
   - Upload a hero image if you have one
   - Or leave blank to use the default pattern

6. **Click "Publish"**

## Phase 5: Test Your Migration

### Test Each Page:
1. **Team**: Visit `/team-cms` - Should show all team members
2. **Research**: Visit `/research-cms` - Should show all research areas  
3. **Home**: Visit `/index-cms` - Should show your custom content
4. **Publications**: Visit `/publications-cms` - Ready for publication data

### Verify Everything Works:
- All images display correctly
- Team members are grouped properly (PI â†’ Lab Manager â†’ Faculty â†’ Research Staff)
- Research areas have navigation and rich text
- Links and email addresses work

## Phase 6: Add Publications (Optional)

Since your current publications come from PubMed, you can either:

### Option A: Keep PubMed Integration
Continue using `/publications` (automatic from PubMed)

### Option B: Migrate to CMS
Manually add key publications to have more control:

1. **Click "Publication" in Sanity Studio**
2. **For each important publication**:
```
Title: [Publication title]
Authors: [Array of author names]
Journal: [Journal name]
Year: [Publication year]
DOI: [DOI if available]
PMID: [PubMed ID if available]
Featured: âœ… (for homepage display)
```

## Phase 7: Update Navigation (Final Step)

Once all content is migrated and tested:

### Update Main Navigation:
Edit your navigation component to point to CMS pages:
- `/team` â†’ `/team-cms`
- `/research` â†’ `/research-cms` 
- `/publications` â†’ `/publications-cms`
- `/` â†’ `/index-cms`

### Or Set Up Redirects:
Add redirects in your hosting configuration:
```
/team â†’ /team-cms
/research â†’ /research-cms
/publications â†’ /publications-cms
```

- Verify image file names match exactly
- Try re-uploading through Sanity Studio

### Content Not Appearing:
- Ensure documents are published (not just saved as drafts)
- Check that the Sanity client is connected properly
- Verify the project ID is correct: `fyi47z1v`

### Studio Not Loading:
- Make sure you're running `npm run sanity:dev`
- Check `http://localhost:3333` 
- Clear browser cache if needed

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Batch Processing**: Do all team members first, then research areas
2. **Copy-Paste**: Keep JSON files open for easy copying
3. **Preview**: Use the preview pane in Sanity Studio to see formatted content
4. **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work in the studio simultaneously
5. **Backup**: Your original static pages remain unchanged as backup

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

Once migration is complete, your colleagues can manage all content through the beautiful Sanity Studio interface - no coding required!
