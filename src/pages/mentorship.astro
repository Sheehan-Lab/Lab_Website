          <p>
            My goal as your mentor is to help you become the type of scientist you want to be, whether it is in industry or academics, 
            basic, translational or clinical, whether you stay in hematology or take the skills you've learned to another discipline. My PhD was in virology, 
            for example; now I study sickle cell disease. While my focus is to guide you in performing independent research, I seek to contribute to the 
            development of the whole person.

            <h3>Personalized Development</h3>
            <p>
              To do that, I need to understand your current intellectual and professional state as well as your future plans. 
              Each person I mentor is different, and may have different goals, but I will help you develop certain universal skills:
            </p>
            <ul class="skills-list">
              <li>How to ask a compelling scientific question</li>
              <li>How to design experiments to answer it</li>
              <li>How to interpret and present your findings</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Lab Mission</h3>
            <p>
              I will work tirelessly for the good of the lab. The success of every member of our group is my top priority. As part of my job as PI, I am 
              expected to write grants and initiate research that will make meaningful contributions to science, the academic community, and to society.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight">
          You should expect to have other mentors with other strengths, and know I support activities that broaden your personal 
          and professional development. I'm happy to help you network and identify other mentors.

        <h2>My Commitments to You</h2>
        <div class="grid-3">
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Advocacy & Support</h3>
            <p>
              I will be your advocate. If you have a problem or challenge, come and see me. I will do my best to listen and identify a path that will assist 
              in resolving or moving forward.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Professional Development</h3>
            <p>
              I will facilitate your training in complementary skills needed to be a successful scientist. These include oral 
              and written communication skills, grant writing experience, compliance with all grant and publication guidelines, scientific policy, and professionalism.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Career Growth</h3>
            <p>
              I will encourage you to apply for awards, fellowships, and similar opportunities. If you commit to applying for an award or fellowship, I will 
              work with you to ensure that your application is competitive.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Written Feedback</h3>
            <p>
              I will provide you with feedback on your written work. Preparing scientific presentations, publications, and abstracts across groups and formats 
              is a learned skill that requires writing and re-writing.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Conference Support</h3>
            <p>
              I will encourage you to attend scientific/professional meetings and will try to fund such activities. You should expect to attend at least one 
              major conference per year when you have material to present.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Mentoring Style</h3>
            <p>
              I will strive to be supportive, equitable, accessible, encouraging, and respectful. I am human and can be impatient, short-tempered, 
              sleep-deprived, and forgetful, but I will always seek to be kind and respectful to you in our interactions.
