Vivien earned a PhD in Biochemistry from Texas A&M before entering medical school at Emory University School of Medicine. At Emory, Dr. Sheehan was inspired by her patients with sickle cell disease, and decided to devote her career to sickle cell research and patient care.\n\nShe then went on to complete a med-peds residency and two fellowships, pediatric Heme Onc at St Jude Children's Research Hospital and Internal Medicine Hematology at the University of Tennessee. Dr. Sheehan spent 8 years at Baylor College of Medicine, developing her research program, which includes omics, transition from acute to chronic pain, fetal hemoglobin regulation, gene therapy and red cell rheology research.\n\nVivien moved to Atlanta in 2020 and is now an Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine, where she directs their translational sickle cell disease research program.",

Her work focuses on developing non-opioid disease-modifying therapies to address pain in SCD. Dr. Goldsborough is also working to identify biomarkers that distinguish acute pain from baseline and disease severity and evaluate treatment efficacy. As a FIRST Program scholar, she is part of a NIH-funded initiative dedicated to fostering inclusive excellence in biomedical research through structured mentorship, professional development, and leadership training. Kennedy, known by her students as Dr. G, is also a biochemistry instructor at Spelman College, where she is committed to mentorship and continues to guide undergraduate researchers in experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication. Through her work, she aims to advance novel pain management strategies for SCD while fostering the next generation of scientists.",
